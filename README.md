The reasoning behind the piece’s design: 

Everyone loves the long line piece. It fits neatly and allows you to full tetris, completing 4 rows at once. So, what if I added an even bigger line piece. The piece is 1 block taller and allows you to SUPER TETRIS, getting 5 rows at once. It creates a much more eazy game feel having 2 line pieces in the game.

The custom gameplay experience demonstrates the piece’s potential: 

The designed custom gameplay experience, besides being able to get tetris with 5 rows, is the addition of the in game timer that I added. Which once counts done to zero, from 200, sends you to a different screen that says times up! Meaning you only have 200 seconds to get as many points as you can. As a result, the game gets just a little bit more stressful due to the need to get as much score as possible. Thankfully, with the addition of the 5 long line piece the game also gets significantly less stressful to play, due to the extra chance of getting a line piece. Meaning the timer and the 5long line pieces kind of counteract each other where one makes the game harder and the other makes the game easier. This demonstrates the potential of the 5long line piece as a way of counteracting more ways of increasing difficulty/stress!

Challenges faced during implementation and how they were addressed: 

I faced quite a few challenges trying to use Devons base Tetris code as I was very sick during the time the code was handed out. As a result, I had to rely on intuition and knowledge of code to apply my own designs and make sure it worked with the given framework. Along the way I even managed to fix things from the code to make my version work better.
